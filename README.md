## 🔧 About Me

After 20 years as a professional bicycle mechanic, I've transitioned into frontend development, bringing the same attention to detail and systematic problem-solving approach that kept bikes running smoothly to building web applications.

**My unique perspective:**
- **Debugging mindset**: Two decades of diagnosing complex mechanical systems
- **User-focused**: Understanding what customers actually need vs. what they ask for  
- **Quality craftsmanship**: Building things that work reliably under real-world conditions
- **Continuous learning**: Technology changes fast in both bikes and code
